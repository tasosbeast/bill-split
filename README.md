# Bill Split

This project is a Vite-powered React application for tracking shared expenses between friends. The instructions below explain how to install dependencies, run automated checks, and start the development server so you can visually inspect your changes.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or later (which includes `npm`).

## Installation

Install the project dependencies once you have cloned the repository:

```bash
npm install
```

## Available scripts

Run the linter to ensure the codebase passes the automated quality checks:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Start the development server and open the application in your browser to inspect UI changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, Vite prints the local and network URLs to the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`). Open the displayed URL in your browser to view the updated application. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is enabled, so edits you make will refresh automatically without restarting the server.

## Building for production

Generate an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```
