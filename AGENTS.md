# Agents

This document tracks the automated ‚Äúagents‚Äù that power the Bill Split experience.
In this codebase an **agent** is a deliberate bundle of logic that owns an
automation loop: it takes well-defined inputs, performs a focused computation or
side effect, and exposes a stable contract to the rest of the app. Capturing
these responsibilities here helps keep analytical features composable as the
project grows.

## System Map

| Agent | Responsibility | Main Implementation | Inputs | Outputs | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Transactions Agent** | Ingest, sanitize, persist the canonical list of transactions and budgets. | `src/state/transactionsStore.ts` | Raw persisted payloads, UI mutations | In-memory store + persistence layer events | ‚úÖ Active |
| **Analytics Agent** | Derive spend totals, trends, and budget deltas for dashboards. | `src/utils/analytics.ts`, `src/lib/analytics.js` | Sanitized transactions, budgets | Aggregated metrics (category totals, monthly buckets, budget comparisons) | ‚úÖ Active |
| **Balances Agent** | Track who owes whom and surface top balances. | `src/lib/analytics.js` (`computeFriendBalances`) | Transaction effects | Sorted friend balance list | ‚úÖ Active |
| **Budget Agent** | Manage category-level budgets and utilization figures. | `src/state/transactionsStore.ts`, `src/utils/analytics.ts` (`compareBudgetByCategory`) | Budget settings, spend totals | Budget aggregates, remaining allowances | ‚úÖ Active |
| **UI Orchestrator** | Compose agent outputs into user-facing analytics. | `src/pages/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`, `src/components/Analytics*` | Agent outputs via selectors/hooks | Dashboard cards, charts, lists | ‚úÖ Active |

## Data Flow

```
Persistence ‚ûú Transactions Agent ‚ûú Analytics/Budget/Balances Agents ‚ûú UI Orchestrator
```

1. **Persistence** (`src/state/persistence.ts`) loads the serialized snapshot.
2. **Transactions Agent** normalizes categories, participants, and totals, then
   emits a clean `TransactionsState`.
3. Specialized agents consume that state to compute domain-specific insights:
   - Analytics Agent: totals, monthly spend, trend data (`monthlySpendPerCategory`, `totalSpendPerCategory`, `computeMonthlyTrend`).
   - Budget Agent: category targets and utilization (`selectBudgetAggregates`, `compareBudgetByCategory`).
   - Balances Agent: friend deltas for settlement views (`computeFriendBalances`).
4. **UI Orchestrator** pulls from `src/lib/selectors.js` and renders React components.

## Contracts & Testing

- **Input contracts**: All agents expect sanitized transactions. When adding new
  fields to the persisted model, update `sanitizeTransaction` and related helpers
  in `src/state/transactionsStore.ts`.
- **Output stability**: Functions exported from `src/utils/analytics.ts` and
  `src/lib/analytics.js` should stay pure and deterministic. Guard them with
  Vitest suites (`src/utils/__tests__/analytics.test.ts`) before shipping.
- **Selectors**: Any new agent output exposed to React should go through a
  selector or hook to keep the components decoupled from implementation details.

## Adding a New Agent

1. **Define the loop**: Document the responsibility, inputs, and desired
   outputs. Validate that no existing agent already owns the work.
2. **Implement in isolation**: Favor pure utilities (mirroring
   `src/utils/analytics.ts`) or a dedicated module under `src/state/` when state
   is required. Keep dependencies minimal.
3. **Expose via selector**: Add a selector/hook that returns a stable shape for
   React or other consumers.
4. **Test and document**: Provide Vitest coverage and update this table with the
   new agent‚Äôs name, scope, and status.

## Open Questions / Future Agents

- Should import or reconciliation flows (e.g., bank CSV ingestion) live under a
  dedicated **Import Agent**?
- Do we need a **Notification Agent** to highlight anomalies or overdue
  settlements?
- How should streaming or real-time collaboration be represented if it lands on
  the roadmap?

capabilities exist and where to extend the system.
